## Penitential Rite

ALMIGHTY God,
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
maker of all things, judge of all men:

We acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness, which we from time to time most grievously have committed, by thought, word, and deed, against thy divine majesty, provoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us.

We do earnestly repent,
and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings;
the remembrance of them is grievous unto us,
the burden of them is intolerable.

Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us,
most merciful Father; for thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, forgive us all that is past;
and grant that we may ever hereafter serve and please thee in newness of life, to the honour and glory of thy Name; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.

(Find the Agnus Dei by organ music)

## Prayer of Humble Access: 

We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in thy manifold and great mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the crumbs under thy Table. But thou art the same Lord whose property is always to have mercy.

Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink his Blood, that our sinful bodies may be made clean by his Body, and our souls washed through his most precious Blood, and that we may evermore dwell in him, and he in us. Amen.

## At Communion:

(For about a minute)

In union, dear Lord, with all the faithful at every altar of thy Church where the blessed Body and Blood are being offered to the Father, I desire to offer thee praise and thanksgiving. I believe thou art truly present in the Most Holy Sacrament.

And since I cannot now receive thee sacramentally, I beseech thee to come spiritually into my heart. I unite myself unto thee, and embrace thee with all the affections of my soul. Let me never be separated from thee. Let me live and die in thy love.

Amen.

## After Communion

ALMIGHTY and everliving God,
we most heartily thank thee for that thou dost feed us, in these holy mysteries,
with the spiritual food of the most precious Body and Blood of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ;
and dost assure us thereby of thy favour and goodness towards us; and that we are very members incorporate in the mystical body of thy Son,
the blessed company of all faithful people; and are also heirs, through hope, of thy everlasting kingdom,
by the merits of the most precious death and Passion of thy dear Son.

And we humbly beseech thee, O heavenly Father, so to assist us with thy grace,
that we may continue in that holy fellowship, and do all such good works as thou hast prepared for us to walk in; through Jesus Christ our Lord,
to whom, with thee and the Holy Spirit,
be all honour and glory, world without end.

Amen.


### Postlude (optional):

Anima Christi: “Soul of Christ, sanctify me. Body of Christ, save me. Blood of Christ, inebriate me. Water from the side of Christ, wash me. Passion of Christ, strengthen me. O good Jesus, hear me. Within Thy wounds hide me. Separated from Thee let me never be. From the malignant enemy, defend me. At the hour of death, call me. And close to Thee bid me. That with Thy saints I may be praising Thee, forever and ever. Amen.”

### St. Michael Prayer:
St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Hosts, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits that prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.
