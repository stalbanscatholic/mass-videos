Input basic information

Title: 

St. Alban’s Divine Worship Mass for {{mass}} {{year}}

Note: When it comes to choosing whether to use the official title vs common title, such as between Sixth Sunday of Easter or Rogation Sunday, I tend to err on using the common title (Divine Mercy Sunday, Candlemas, Corpus Christi Sunday, Gaudete Sunday, Laetare Sunday, etc.). It keeps titles shorter. However, I make sure the full name of the Sunday is in the body itself). 

Body:

Alleluia, Christ is risen! Welcome to St. Alban’s 11 AM Divine Worship Mass for the [6th Sunday of Easter, commonly called Rogation Sunday]. Our parish priest is {{priest}}. Please join us for a virtual coffee hour after Sunday Mass over Zoom at 12:15 P.M.
